# Radio-Network-Design
Wireless and Mobile Propagation Project - Polimi
The design of a robust and efficient Private Mobile Radio (PMR) network is critical for
supporting professional users including emergency services, security personnel, and other
mission-critical operations. This project mainly focuses on designing a PMR network for an
area inside the city of Mashhad, in Iran, operating at a frequency of 158 MHz with ETSI Digital
Mobile Radio (DMR) modulation. The network will utilize Motorola SLR5500 repeater stations
and DM4000e vehicular terminals (train radios), interconnected via point-to-point microwave
links to ensure seamless communication across the region.
The primary objective of this project is to utilize a minimum number of repeaters while
ensuring comprehensive coverage and reliable connectivity. Key challenges include
optimizing repeater placement on mountain tops or high elevations to maximize line-of-sight
(LOS) coverage, designing an efficient microwave interconnection network with appropriate
frequency selection and antenna specifications for repeaters, and validating the network's
performance using RADIOMOBILE software.
This report will detail the network's structure, including repeater locations, transmit power,
antenna configurations, and microwave link design, supported by radio coverage maps and
Fresnel zone analysis. The outcomes will demonstrate a cost-effective and high-performance
PMR network tailored to the geographical and technical requirements of the Mashhad region.
